### Overview

The client W. Avy would like more information about temperature trends before opening. In order to determine viability of year-round business the client has requested temperature data in June and December in Ouhu.

### Analysis

For <b>June</b> we have 1700 data points:

- There is an average temperature of 74.94°f. 
- The highest recorded temperature of 85°f 
- The lowest recorded temperature of 64°f.

In <b>December</b> we have fewer data points at 1517 counts:

- There is an average temperature of 71.04°f. 
- The highest recorded temperature of 83°f 
- The lowest recorded temperature of 56°f.

### Results

This shows that there is not a huge disparity in temperature ranges in summer and winter and therefore W. Avy's ice cream business has a chance at year-round success. It would have been problematic if December's temperatures were significantly lower than the temperature in June as fewer people might want to eat ice cream in the cold (unless they are Norwegians who love ice cream year-round). 

Further climate analysis would be useful. It would be useful to see rates of precipitation for those months as intense rainy periods may effect walk-up traffic and time spent outdoors. Also if there were data about cloudiness or hours of sunshine, that may also be useful knowledge.
